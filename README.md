# AWS-Building-a-3-Tier-Architecture
Build a 3-tier architecture on AWS by setting up a web layer (EC2 or ALB), an application layer (EC2, ECS, or Lambda), and a database layer (RDS or DynamoDB), each in separate subnets for security and scalability. Use VPC, security groups, and load balancers to manage traffic and isolation.
