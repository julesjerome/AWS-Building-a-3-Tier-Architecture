# AWS-Building-a-3-Tier-Architecture
Build a 3-tier architecture on AWS by setting up a web layer (EC2 or ALB), an application layer (EC2, ECS, or Lambda), and a database layer (RDS or DynamoDB), each in separate subnets for security and scalability. Use VPC, security groups, and load balancers to manage traffic and isolation.
### **Introduction**
When building a cloud-based application, it’s vital to consider three key aspects of the architecture:

**Scalability**: How easily the app can scale up or down without frequent manual intervention.
**Availability**: The app’s ability to remain operational over long periods and withstand failures in individual components.
**Security**: Protecting the app from vulnerabilities, managing permissions, and ensuring one compromised part doesn’t affect the whole system.
These factors ensure the application is robust, efficient, and secure.

By addressing these considerations, you can ensure that your cloud-based application is robust, scalable, and secure, setting a strong foundation for long-term success.
In this article, we’ll explore how to build a 3-tier architecture on AWS, a common design pattern that divides applications into three layers:

**Web/Presentation Tier**: Houses the user-facing elements of the application, such as web servers and the interface/front-end.
**Application Tier**: Houses the backend and application source code needed to process data and run functions.
**Data Tier**: Houses and manages the application data. Often where the databases are stored.
